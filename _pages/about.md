# ~ website under construction ~

Hi there!

My name is Peter Werner. I am a 2nd-year PhD student in Prof. Daniela Rus' lab at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at MIT.  

My research interests are broadly centered around Mathematics, especially Control Theory and Optimization, and Robotics. While my interests tend more towards theory and software, nothing is more convicing, than an actual hardware system executing an approach - there is no hiding or glossing over details.  

Currently, I am working on a joint project with the Toyota Research Institute focused on Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning for autonomous racing. More on that will follow in due time.

In the meantime, enjoy browsing my website!
