Hi there!

My name is Peter Werner and I am a 2nd-year PhD student in Prof. Daniela Rus' lab at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, MA.  

My research interests are broadly centered around Mathematics, especially Control Theory and Optimization, and Robotics. Nothing is as convincing to me as an actual hardware system that is executing your previously theorized approach - there is no hiding or glossing over details. 

Currently, I am working on a joint project with the Toyota Research Institute focused on Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning for autonomous racing. More on that will follow in due time.

In the meantime enjoy browsing my website!
